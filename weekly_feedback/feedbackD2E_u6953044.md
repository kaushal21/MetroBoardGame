Your code is clean, well-formatted and well-commented and you implement a nice helper method for task 7.

I cannot find the tests you wrote for the method in GetScoreTest, but I do find the test code in OurTests.java. 
You wrote one good test case for scorePlayer() method, but it is not sufficient to have only one test case for this method. 
It would be nice if you could include error messages in your test, which will help you identify the problem if your code fail the test. 

I suggest that you put tests written for different functions in different test classes and properly name the classes. 
The name "OurTest" carries little information.
