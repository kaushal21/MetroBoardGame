Your code is well-formatted and clean, which contributes to both the logic part and GUI part of the Metro game.
The code in the Viewer works well, nice! It would be better if you could separate the code for the Viewer and the actual GUI for the game. 
The Viewer is created for your own benefits, to help you visualize the tile placement sequence when debugging your code. 
The helper function in the Score class looks useful. 
Maybe you need to consider whether the outputPosition that the method return can be larger than 7 in some cases, and how you would deal with it.
