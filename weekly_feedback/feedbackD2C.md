comments:

Well done. All tests of part one are passed. 
Your code is nice and clean, with sufficient comments and documentation.
You also make good use of the classes you created before and add proper helper methods.
In addition to fix-sized Array, you may find some other data structures helpful as well, like ArrayList, HashMap and so on. 
They are more flexible and provide some methods you may use directly when implementing your solution, 
instead of writing your own methods or code to achieve some functions.

It seems that the Viewer can only accept single-tile placement string. 
I suggest that you use another class to implement actual game GUI. 
The viewer class is created for your own benefits, it helps you visualize the tile placement when debugging your code.
