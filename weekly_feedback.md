The skeleton has reasonable classes, fields and methods. 
The skeleton design could be more thoroughly. 
For example, You could also think about how you would deal with the coordinates on the board and the tracks on tiles. 
You can also consider using inheritance and interfaces in your design.
It would be better to add docstrings to each method to describe its functionality.
