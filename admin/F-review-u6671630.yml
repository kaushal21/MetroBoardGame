comments:
  -Comments are well placed and describe what is happening in that section or line of code. The for loops used
  to check the number of certain tiles on the board are well coded and the comments help to understand what is
  happening. The style and format of the code is consistent throughout the function thus making it easier to
  understand. None of the code goes of the screen which is good. Just a personal change is adding in the {} brackets
  with if statements even if the code is one line so it is easier to see what is executed by the if statements.
